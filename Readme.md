# Deriving efficient, evidence-based Diagnostic Paths from Past Diagnoses using Bayesian Model Averaging

Diagnostic Paths constitute the basic guidelines of laboratory diagnostics in an ICD-10-funded hospital environment.

Although they are designed to lead diagnosis along the analytes of highest known significance thus avoiding unnecessary tests, they are based on agreements among experts and therefore reflect opinions, not scientific evidence.

In this paper, we derive Diagnostic Paths from previously collected lab measurements and the resulting diagnoses using an algorithmic framework called Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA).
